# DeepSZ
This repository contains the codes used for the paper "DeepSZ: Identification of Sunyaev-Zelâ€™dovich Galaxy Clustersusing Deep Learning". 

# MF Codes
The codes used for matched filters are proprietary, so we won't be releasing them.

# CNN Codes
Please refer to README in `./CNN`. 

After running the codes according to README, 
we can run the following

# Analysis and Everything else

Please see `./paper/Paper Notebook Calibrate.ipynb`, 
which includes all the pictures used in the paper (and how they are created).

For quick replication, we've attached the trained model (history and weights) in `CNN/deepsz1` and cached dataframe with all sorts of information in `data/cache`. 
You should be able to run the notebook with these data directly.
